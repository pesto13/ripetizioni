OTHER TYPES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS: 
WLAN (WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK). A WIRELESS NETWORK IS ANY TYPE OF COMPUTER NETWORK THAT USES WIRELESS DATA CONNECTIONS IN ORDER TO CONNECT DEVICES (NETWORK NODES) OR NETWORKS. WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK (WLAN) LINKS TWO OR MORE DEVICES USING SOME WIRELESS DISTRIBUTION METHODS. THESE SYSTEMS GENERALLY USE LOW POWER RADIO WAVES (RADIO FREQUENCY - RF). THE MOST WIDELY SPREAD WLAN TECHNOLOGY IS THE WIRELESS FIDELITY (WI-FI) (IEEE 802.11 STANDARDS).
WPAN (WIRELESS PERSONAL AREA NETWORK). WIRELESS PERSONAL AREA NETWORK (WPANS) INTERCONNECTS DEVICES WITHIN A RELATIVELY SMALL AREA; IT CONNECTS DEVICES PLACED AROUND A PERSON'S WORKSPACE (TYP: DEVICES WORN BY A PERSON, PLACED IN A CAR OR ON A DESKTOP). 
EXAMPLE OF COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES USED IN WPAN ARE BLUETOOTH RADIO AND INVISIBLE INFRARED LIGHT.
COMMUNICATION MEDIA
THE MOST WIDELY SPREAD COMMUNICATION MEDIA USED TO LINK DEVICES TO FORM A COMPUTER NETWORK ARE ELECTRICAL CABLE, OPTICAL FIBER AND RADIO WAVES.
DEVICES INVOLVED IN A NETWORK: 
HOST -> IT IS A DEVICE CONNECTED TO A COMPUTER NETWORK. IT IS NAMED LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT HOSTS RESOURCES, SERVICES, AND APPLICATIONS TO USERS OR OTHER DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK. 
HUB -> AN ETHERNET HUB, ACTIVE HUB, NETWORK HUB, REPEATER HUB, MULTIPORT REPEATER OR HUB IS A DEVICE FOR THE CONNECTION OF MULTIPLE (ETHERNET) HOSTS AND MAKES THEM ACT AS A SINGLE NETWORK SEGMENT. ITS FUNCTIONS ARE NOW FULFILLED BY SWITCHES.
